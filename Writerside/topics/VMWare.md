# VMWare

VMWare is an interesting choice for a vm that bypasses
anti vms given its closed source nature. However, due to its
gpu virtualization and advanced options, it's incredibly capable
and in some cases preferred.

This guide will go over making VMWare less prone to detection.

## Notes
- VMWare Workstation Pro is preferred, however it is also paid.
- VMWare Workstation Pro 17 is the latest version as of the time of writing.
